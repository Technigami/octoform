0) All of these things should be automated.

1) Set the variables in apps/forms/settings.py. Mostly this is just a matter of
setting the path correctly. 

2) Create the octoforms database. Typically something like this should work:

# yum install postgresql  postgresql-server
su - postgres 
psql
create database octoforms;
grant all on database octoforms to <user running octoforms>;

3) Install dependencies:

* psycopg2 
* mako
