-- OCTO FORMS --

A form management application which can be used to generate input/output
agnostic forms. Once a form is created using octo forms, you can output it
using any available filters (currently HTML or PDF), and then collect
data using either OCR or an HTML interface. For OCR to work correctly, you 
must allow OctoForms to print a barcode on the form to identify what form
is being analyzed as well as certain markers to assist in orienting the form.

Whew. That was a lot. 

Currently the code base is in a very unstable configuration as it has been
ported from Django to Turbo Gears and all proprietary information has been
deleted. 

If you want to use this code, I suggest you contact myself, Charles Shiflett,
and I will help you.
