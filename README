-- OCTO FORMS --

A form management application which can be used to generate input/output
agnostic forms. Once a form is created using octo forms, you can view it
using any available filters (currently HTML or PDF), then collect infor-
mation with either OCR or an HTML interface. Internally, form collection
is based on an append only data model where a form can be updated,  but,
form information can never be erased.  For OCR to work, you must allow a
barcode to be imprinted,  which enables OctoForms to orient and identify
specific regions of the form being analyzed.

Whew. That was a lot. 

Currently the code base is in an unstable configuration as it was ported
from Django to Python and "rm -rf proprietary information". This code is
meant to work with any framework that has the ability to execute Python.

If you want to use this code, please contact me, Charles Shiflett, and I
will help you. Also, make sure to check the docs directory for more info
regarding what OctoForms is and how to use OctoForms.
